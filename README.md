Calculator for Pre 1.9 Minecraft Java Speedrunning
by KingContaria


How to use the Calculator:

After throwing an eye, point your crosshair at the eye of ender, then fill your x and z coordinate and the horizontal angle you are looking at into the first Textfield. Leave spaces between the values.
Now turn 90Â°, run for a bit and then repeat this process for a second eyethrow and fill in the values into the second Textfield.
Now click the 'Find' Button and the calculator will output the coordinates of the stronghold. Depending on the distance between eyethrow, the distance of the stronghold and your accuracy when taking the angle those coordinates might not be exact.

Buttons:

Settings - This will open up a window with settings.
Clear - This will clear all TextFields and remove stronghold coordinates and other values.

Settings:

Show Distance to SH - If this is enabled, additionally to the coordinates of the stronghold the program will also give you its distance.
Distance from - This determines the point from where distance to the stronghold is calculated, either the x and z coordinate from your first, your second or both your eyethrows.

Always On Top - If this is enabled, the window will always stay on top, even when other windows are selected (for example Minecraft).
Autoclear - If this is enabled, after you press 'Find' a timer will start after which the Calculator will automatically get cleared. The timer will start over if you press 'Find' and get cancelled if you press 'Clear'.
